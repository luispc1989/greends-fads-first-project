## The answers to questions of Exercice_2:

###5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?
The command cp ../temp-* . copies all files starting with "temp-" from the directory one level above (../) to the current directory (.).
It uses the wildcard * to match any characters following "temp-".

---

###5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?

We didn't need to run git init because the repository was cloned from an existing Git repository. 
The git clone command automatically initializes a repository with its version history and configuration.

---

###5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.

Yes, to commit the copied files we need to follow some steps on the Git Bash terminal:

    1.Add the files to the staging area, using the folowwing command: 
       → git add temp-data.csv temp-average.py temp-doc.txt
    
    2.Commit the changes with a message, using the folowwing command: 
       → git commit -m " Added temperature analysis files"

After executing these commands, the files will be committed to the local repository and ready to be pushed to the remote repository, if needed, using git push.
